# Lab Report 1 - Remote Access and Filesystem
Welcome to my blog! In this section, we will discuss how filesystem commands work.

**cd Command**
The cd command is used to change the directory of the terminal.

In this scenario, with no arguments cd would not do anything unless a directory is called. When called on the directory of lecture 1, the directory is changed to lecture 1. When cd is called on a file, it will not do anything because cd only works moving between directories.

**ls Command**
The ls command is used to list files in the directory it is in.

In this scenario, we are in the directory of lecture1. When ls is called without arguments, it lists all the files in the lecture1 directory. When ls is called on a directory, in this case, messages, it lists all the files that are in the messages directory. When called on a file, it lists the file name.

**cat Command**
The cat command is used to view files and give the content of the file.
