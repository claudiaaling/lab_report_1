# Lab Report 1 - Remote Access and Filesystem
Welcome to my blog! In this section, we will discuss how filesystem commands work.

**Cd Command**
The cd command is used to change the directory of the terminal.

In this scenario, with no arguments cd would not do anything unless a directory is called. When called on the directory of lecture 1, the directory is changed to lecture 1. When cd is called on a file, it will not do anything because cd only works moving between directories.
